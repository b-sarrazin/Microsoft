# Split-AppLockerXml

**Split-AppLockerXml** is a PowerShell script that splits a full AppLocker XML policy file into individual XML files based on `RuleCollection` types (Appx, Dll, Exe, Msi, Script). This makes it easier to manage or import specific rule types into tools like **Microsoft Intune**.
